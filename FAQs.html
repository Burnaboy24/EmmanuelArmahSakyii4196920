                   <svg width="15" height="10" viewBox="0 0 42 25">

                    <p>If you're involved in an accident or there is damage to the rental car, you should immediately contact the car rental company and inform them about the situation. The specific procedures may vary, but here are the general steps to follow:

                      Ensure everyone's safety: If there are any injuries, contact emergency services for medical assistance.
                      Report the incident: Contact the car rental company's emergency helpline or the local branch to report the accident or damage. They will provide you with instructions on what to do next.</p>

                  <div class="question">
                   <h4>Is insurance included in the car rental price?</h4>
                   <svg width="15" height="10" viewBox="0 0 42 25">
                     <path d="M3 3L21 21L39 5" stroke="black" stroke-width="7" stroke-linecap="round"/>

                  </div>
                  <div class="answer">
                    <p>Car rental websites typically offer both basic insurance coverage and additional coverage options. The inclusion of insurance in the rental price depends on the website and the specific rental package you choose. Basic insurance coverage often includes collision damage waiver (CDW) or loss damage waiver (LDW), which reduces your financial liability in case of damage or theft of the rental vehicle. However, it's important to note that basic coverage may have deductibles or exclusions. Additional insurance options, such as personal accident insurance or supplemental liability insurance, may be available for an extra cost. It's advisable to carefully review the insurance details and consider your needs before making a decision.</p>

                   <h4> Can I modify or cancel my car rental reservation?</h4>
                   <svg width="15" height="10" viewBox="0 0 42 25">

                  <div class="answer">
                    <p>In most cases, car rental reservations can be modified or canceled, but it depends on the terms and conditions of the car rental company and the specific booking you made. It's important to carefully review the cancellation and modification policies before confirming your reservation. Some companies may allow free modifications or cancellations within a certain time frame, while others may charge a fee or have stricter policies. Contacting the car rental company directly or accessing your reservation online is the best way to initiate any changes or cancellations.</p>
